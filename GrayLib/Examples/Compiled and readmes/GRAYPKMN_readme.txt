GRAYPKMN, by Runer112 (Zachary Wassall), compiled with Axe 1.2.1 & GrayLib v1.0.

A faithful visual recreation of Pallet Town from Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow 
to wander around in! At least I think it's pretty faithful... I spent long 
hours laboring over the process of converting the tileset and Ash's sprites 
from 16x16 to 8x8, as well as studying the movement logic of the original games 
on a frame-by-frame basis. No NPCs, warps, or other areas, sorry! It's just an 
example grayscale program, you know! But maybe it will become more than an 
example eventually...

An 83+SE or 84+ is NOT needed to run this, although the grayscale quality won't 
be quite as good without one.

Controls:
 - Arrow keys to move.
 - VARS to launch the grayscale and contrast tuner.
 - TAN to enable experimental grayscale mask compensation when scrolling.
 - ^ to toggle doubled scrolling speed. On by default for 83+ calculators.
 - CLEAR to quit.

Tuner controls:
 - Up and down arrows to adjust contrast. Up is darker, down is lighter.
 - Left and right arrows to adjust grayscale timing. Left is more frequent, 
     right is less frequent.
 _ Any other key to finish.
