GRAYTUNE, by Runer112 (Zachary Wassall), compiled with Axe 1.2.1 & GrayLib v1.0.

A basic GrayLib program that provides the default grayscale and contrast tuner.

An 83+SE or 84+ is NOT needed to run this, although the grayscale quality won't 
be quite as good without one.

Controls:
 - Up and down arrows to adjust contrast. Up is darker, down is lighter.
 - Left and right arrows to adjust grayscale timing. Left is more frequent, 
     right is less frequent.
 _ CLEAR to quit.
